I've been asked a few times recently about how to learn [**American Sign Language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language) (ASL), so I wanted to share some advice for those interested in starting their journey.

The best way to learn ASL is to learn directly from Deaf people. This can include:
- Enrolling in an ASL class taught by a Deaf instructor
- Attending Deaf events in your area
- Building friendships with Deaf individuals
- Volunteering with organizations that serve the Deaf community

While nothing can replace the experience of learning from Deaf people, there are also many excellent online resources available for those who may not have access to in-person opportunities. Below, I've compiled a list of resources that I personally recommend.

## Online Resources

- ### [Lifeprint](https://www.lifeprint.com/)
  - [Dr. Bill Vicars](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/instructor.htm) is a Deaf ASL professor at California State University, Sacramento. He has a ton of free resources on Lifeprint, including a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/billvicars) with hundreds of videos.
- ### [Handspeak](https://www.handspeak.com/)
  - [Jolanta Lapiak](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/1/) is a Deaf ASL instructor, and the founder of Handspeak. The dictionary on this website is one of the best I've found.

### Fingerspelling

I would strongly recommend learning fingerspelling early on. It's a very important part of ASL, and it's used quite often. It's also a great way to learn new vocabulary and can serve as a fallback when you don't know a sign. Just be careful not to [overuse it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYAVL1Dxokk)!

## Local Resources

If you by chance live in the Seattle metropolitan area like I do, there are a few local resources I'd recommend.

- Go to Deaf Events in Seattle
- [Visually Speaking](https://www.visuallyspeaking.info/)
- [Bellevue College ASL Classes](https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/worldlanguages/departments/american-sign-language-asl/)
- [More resources at Hearing, Speech & Deaf Center (HSDC)](https://hsdc.org/education/resources/)

## Conclusion

I hope this helps! Whether you're learning ASL for the first time, or you're brushing up on your skills, I wish you the best of luck. üòä

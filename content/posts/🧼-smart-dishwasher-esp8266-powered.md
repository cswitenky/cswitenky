As a deaf person, something as simple as knowing when the dishwasher is done isn't always so simple.

Most dishwashers beep or a tiny light to let you know that the cycle is finished - but that doesn't help if you can't hear it or if you're not standing right in front of it. For me, that means an extra step: walking over to check if it's done. And if I forget? Which always happens. Dishes just sit there.

It's one of those little things that adds up - another small barrier that most people don't notice - an afterthought, but it's always there.

I had a smarter solution - use an ESP8266. It's low-cost and DIY friendly which is great because it's portable and I can move it from an apartment to an apartment.

I'm going to use it to send myself a Pushover notification - something I can actually notice, no matter where I am.


This project is one way I'm making everyday tech work harder for _me_.

I took a cue from racing sim enthusiasts, home theater geeks, and gamers -- and added a bass shaker (aka tactile transducer) to my setup.

I mounted it under the couch and paired it with a WiiM for smart control and automation. It connects wirelessly to my Apple TV using AirPlay, so no extra wires or bulky receivers -- seamless.

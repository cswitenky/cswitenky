Have you ever wanted to learn [American Sign Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language) (ASL)? Or maybe you're already fluent in ASL and want to meet other Deaf people in the Seattle area? Or maybe you're just curious about Deaf culture and want to learn more? Look no further!

I've compiled a list of recurring Deaf events in Seattle. This is not an exhaustive list, but it's a good start to get you connected with the Deaf community in Seattle.

I've been asked a few times recently about how to learn [**American Sign Language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language) (ASL). Although I am culturally Deaf and fluent, I am not an ASL instructor. That being said, I do have some advice for those who want to learn ASL.

It goes without saying that the _best way to learn ASL is to learn from Deaf people_. If you have the opportunity to take an ASL class from a Deaf instructor, **do it**! If you have the opportunity to attend a Deaf event, **do it**! If you have the opportunity to make Deaf friends, **do it**! There is no substitute for learning from Deaf people.

If you don't have the opportunity to learn from Deaf people, there are still plenty of resources available online. I've compiled a list of resources below that I've found helpful.

## Online Resources

- ### [Lifeprint](https://www.lifeprint.com/)
  - [Dr. Bill Vicars](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/instructor.htm) is a Deaf ASL professor at California State University, Sacramento. He has a ton of free resources on Lifeprint, including a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/billvicars) with hundreds of videos.
- ### [Handspeak](https://www.handspeak.com/)
  - [Jolanta Lapiak](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/1/) is a Deaf ASL instructor, and the founder of Handspeak. The dictionary on this website is one of the best I've found.

## Local Resources

If you by chance live in the Seattle area, there are a few local resources I'd recommend.

## Conclusion

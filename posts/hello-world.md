Printing "hello world" is a common first program when learning a new programming language or platform. It is a simple program that outputs `Hello, World!` on the screen. It is often used to introduce beginners to a programming language.

It has become a tradition in the programming community to use a simple program to illustrate the syntax of a programming language. In addition, it is also used to verify that a language or system is operating correctly.

This phrase originated with the first edition of the book _The C Programming Language_ by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. The book was published in 1978 and contained a simple program that printed "hello world" on the screen.
